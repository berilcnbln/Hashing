# Hashing

Part 1:
I designed the hash table the way it was taught during the course. For the collision resolution, I calculated the number of times I have consecutively visited the numbers that I have already probed before and if that number was equal to the number of elements I hold in my hash table, I would stop probing.
Part 2:
I created 3 test cases in the test.txt that covers every possible scenario that I could think of. Below, I dumped the test cases and outputs to them.
The test case design is as follows:
Number of testcases

Part 3:
Linear probing successful and unsuccessful comparison for test 1. Load factor for the first test case was: 3 / 10
Theoretical successful: 1.21 Practical successful: 3.66 Theoretical unsuccessful: 1.52 Practical unsuccessful: 2.00
Since my results are around 3 times higher than the theoretical ones, you can see that I am more conservative than the best probing algorithm, I donâ€™t give up looking for the element early.

  Quadratic probing and Double hashing successful and unsuccessful probing for test 2 and 3.
Load factor for the first test case was: 3 / 10
Theoretical successful: 1.19 Practical successful: 3.33(Quadratic), 3.25(Double) Theoretical unsuccessful: 1.42 Practical unsuccessful: 1.8(Quadratic), -1(Double)
Since my results are around 1.5 times higher than the theoretical ones, you can see that I am more conservative than the best probing algorithm. At the same time, the results for the quadratic probing ended up being better than for the linear one.
